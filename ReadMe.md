Project 3 React

SUMMARY:

This application was developed to solve the problem of choosing news sources. There are thousands of places to get your news, but which ones are right for you? With this app, you will be able to choose your news sources, get today's top stories from the news outlets, and create a list of your favorite news sources so you can get news tailored to your needs. 

USER STORY (MVP):

1) There will be 1 model, Users.

2) User will be able to log in to the News App, have an encrypted password, and authorization flow.

3) The User will be able to create a new user(register), delete users and edit user information.


TECHNOLOGIES USED:

- Node
- Express
- Mongoose
- MongoDB
- React
- Express Session
- News API

UNSOLVED PROBLEMS:

- We had trouble finding an API that would work consistantly so we had to pivot to find a new API

- Because of the previous problem, we only have CRUD functionality for the user

- Bonus content is pending


BONUS:

1) User will be able to create a list of his favorite news sources.

2) User's favorite news sources will have a ranking

3) User will be able to delete new sources off their favorites list
